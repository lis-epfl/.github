We explore future avenues of artificial intelligence and robotics at the convergence of biology and engineering, humans and machines.

Our research directions:
- **Aerial Robotics**: We take inspiration from nature and study, design, and control of agile aerial robots with rich sensory and motor abilities that can move and work in very different environments
- **Wearable Robotics**: We investigate and develop novel soft wearable robots for natural interactions and symbiosis between humans and robots.
- **Soft Robotics**: We are interested in the study, design, and control of soft robotic technologies that amplify the sensory-motor capabilities and human interaction of robots without increasing their complexity and weight.
